# Prioritizer

This tool helps you efficiently prioritize a list of items.

## How to use

Paste a list of stuff into the big text area on the main page, then follow the directions to rank each item in the list.  Make sure that you put one item per line in the list to ensure the expected results.

Once each item is ranked, it will appear in the "ranked" list and be removed from the "unranked" list.
